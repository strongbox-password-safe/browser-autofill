# Localization - Help Wanted
If you would like to see Strongbox translated into your language just get in touch (support@strongboxsafe.com) and we'll get you access to our localization platform. Localization and translation is managed through the parallel Babel project. This is managed under the MIT licence to avoid issues with the Apple's App Store and ownership:

# Build Issues
The code is provided here in the spirit transparency, security and openness. Anyone can view the code and verify that everything is above board, the algorithms are correct and there are no backdoors or other malicious features present. Please do not file issues about build trouble or problems, they will be closed as "won't fix". What is here is all of the functional code used in building Strongbox Browser AutoFill, other non functional files (e.g. artwork, images, auxilliary and build configs) are not present. Translation strings files are managed in the separate Babel repository. 

# Open Source not Open Contribution
At the moment, we are not accepting pull requests and do not want to manage contributions from others. The code here is under the AGPL which Apple will not allow in the App Store. The code is provided here in the spirit of transparency, security and openness.
